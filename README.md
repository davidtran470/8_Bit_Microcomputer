# 8_Bit_Microcomputer

8-bit computer with 23 instructions and I/O ports with structural VHDL. This project was done with the guide of Brock J. LaMeres - Introduction to Logic Circuits & Logic Design with VHDL (2017). I intend to make changes in the future so that the design will be compatible with my Digilent Spartan 3 board.
